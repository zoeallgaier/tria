# Tria — working notes for Claude

A social web app for small circles of friends. Tagline "Social Media is so back."
Ethos: low-tech, non-addictive, anti-bloat. The app promotes context (long posts
read well), not an infinite feed.

## Stack
Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with a tiny hash router. **No framework, no build step.**
Real multi-user backend on **Supabase** (Auth + Postgres + Storage).

- `index.html` — shell, boot splash, font/manifest links, the `?v=` asset stamps.
- `css/tokens.css` — design tokens. `css/app.css` — everything else.
- `js/config.js` — Supabase URL + publishable key + VAPID public key (safe to commit).
- `js/store.js` — the data layer (in-memory cache of the whole world; sync reads, async writes).
- `js/app.js` — the whole app: router + every view + modals + composer.
- `sw.js` — push-only service worker (caches nothing, on purpose — see below).
- `supabase/` — `schema.sql` (canonical) + additive migrations + `functions/push/` + `PUSH-SETUP.md`.

## Running it
Zoe previews on her **VSCode Live Server** — she strongly prefers seeing changes
live over screenshots, so default to letting her preview. Any static file server
works (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`); Supabase is remote, so there's nothing to
run locally beyond serving the files.

`?demo` in the URL (e.g. `/?demo#/updates`) is a preview aid — it currently forces
the push pre-prompt card to show regardless of permission state. Handy for showing
UI that's otherwise state-gated.

## Deploy
GitHub Pages serves `main` root; every push to `main` auto-redeploys (~1 min).
Push straight to main — no PRs or feature branches.

**The one ritual:** any deploy that touches a css/js file MUST bump the `?v=N`
stamp — the same number on all five asset lines in `index.html`. Use the script:

```sh
./bump.sh        # increment by 1
./bump.sh 70     # set an explicit number
```

The stamp busts HTTP caches AND drives the self-updater in app.js (it refetches
index.html on launch/foreground and reloads when the `app.js?v=` number changed),
which is how friends on home-screen installs get updates. `sw.js` caches nothing
so it won't fight this. Docs/tooling changes (this file, README, bump.sh) don't
touch assets, so they don't need a bump.

## Before you call an app.js/store.js change done
Run a headless boot pass — `node --check` alone once shipped a runtime
ReferenceError (a name deleted but still referenced in a template literal parses
fine). Launch Chromium (Playwright is cached locally), listen for `pageerror` and
console errors, load the page, assert `#view` has content and there are zero
errors. This is a correctness gate separate from Zoe's visual preview.

## Copy style
User-facing copy uses commas and periods, **no em dashes** (code comments are
exempt). Voice is playful but not trying-too-hard.

## Backend notes
- Login is by **email**; username is the public handle. Email confirmation is off.
- The Supabase service key was rotated/deleted, so **only Zoe has DB admin** —
  Claude can't run SQL or clear accounts. Migrations in `supabase/*.sql` are run
  by her in the dashboard (`schema.sql` already folds them in for fresh installs).
- **Private likes** are enforced at the data layer: RLS hides other authors' like
  rows, so the cache can't compute someone else's count. **Headcount/RSVPs are
  public** by design. **Friends are directed edges** (request → mutual on accept).
- Post photos are stored at native aspect ratio (not cropped); only avatars crop
  (circular). Push notifications: see `supabase/PUSH-SETUP.md`; the Edge Function's
  real slug is `swift-processor`, not `push`.

## Design system (short version)
Austere, editorial, cool greyscale base. The only chromatic color is a pastel
quartet reserved for the four post types: note = lavender, find = coral,
photo = cyan, activity = lime. Instrument Serif on titles only; Oxygen everywhere
else. 3px radius; circular avatars. Don't touch the hue-drift gate wash — Zoe
loves it. All motion is reduced-motion aware.
